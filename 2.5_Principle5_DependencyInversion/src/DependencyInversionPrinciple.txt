Dependency Inversion Principle [Wikipedia]
In object-oriented design, the dependency inversion principle refers to a specific form of decoupling software modules. 
When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting
modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level
module implementation details.
The principle states:
        A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
        B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Take Away Message from This Tutorial:
Depend on abstract classes and interfaces because they change less than concrete classes.
