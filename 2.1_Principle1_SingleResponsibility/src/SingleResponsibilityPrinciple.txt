Single Responsibility Principle

The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should have
responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and
that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services 
should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. Robert C. Martin expresses the
principle as follows:

"A class should have only one reason to change."
